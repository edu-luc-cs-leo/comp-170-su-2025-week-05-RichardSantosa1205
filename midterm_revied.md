Midterm Review
At the beginning of this course, I underestimated how demanding it would be. On the first day, we started with basic terms and definitions that I had seen before through my experience with SQL and R-Studio. However, by the end of that first lesson, I realized this class would be very different from what I expected. On the second day, Professor Irakliotis warned us about the speed and amount of material we would cover in just six weeks. His words made me nervous—covering the basics of Python programming in such a short time seemed impossible.

By the end of the first week, I fully understood the challenge ahead. Fortunately, I completed the first assignment on time and with good accuracy. In the second week, the material became more complex, but I managed to keep up with the help of classmates, a personal friend, and online resources like YouTube. Although the homework took me a few days to complete, I learned a lot from the process.

However, by the third week, I began falling behind. I missed classes and did not finish the third week’s assignment. The fourth week was even worse—I missed all my classes and struggled through the homework, but I still managed to complete it with satisfactory results. This week was no better I again missed all my classes, but still managed to pull through with my homework, just in time.

Overall, my progress started strong but declined due to a lack of discipline and poor attendance. I realize now that I need to take responsibility for my learning. Moving forward, I must attend every class, manage my time better, and stay committed to my studies to catch up and succeed in this course.
