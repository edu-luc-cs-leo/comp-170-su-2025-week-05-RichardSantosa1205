MIDTERM REVIEW
Looking at the first five assignments, discuss how you learned from any mistakes you made. Repeating mistakes is a sign that your learning needs to be improved. If you have repeated mistakes, discuss how you learning will be improved in the second half of the course. Typical mistakes for this discussion include:

code that doesn't execute (even in one assignment);
lack of comments;
Missed assignments (even when due to not committing/synchronizing your CodeSpaces);
Looking at your course engagement over the first six weeks, discuss how you've managed so far. The ideal standard is that you treat the course as a job that you like, that you wish to keep, and in which you aspire to grow and be promoted. Factors to consider include:

Timeliness -- joining the class meeting on time
Consistency -- not missing classes (except for university-justified absences)
Participation -- asking questions, answering questions
Proactiveness -- each out to the instructor with any difficulties you encounter, in a way that allows a timely resolution
Initiative -- trying additiona problems from the book and discussing them with the instructor; learning something new, like writing your reflections in MarkDown.
Commitment: studying/working on the course for ~3 hours per hour class-hour, i.e., 9 hours per week in addition to coming to class.
Your discussion for the above should be in the form of a well-written essay, 200-300 words.
