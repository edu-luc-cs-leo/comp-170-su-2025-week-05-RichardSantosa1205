Reflection
Looking back at my version compared to the solution, I see that my code works as intended but could be cleaner and more robust. My functions for finding the longest and shortest words, collecting odd-length words, and finding words near the average length all produce the correct results. However, the solution uses clearer patterns. For example, instead of manually checking words == None and using len(words) == 0, the solution uses if words, which is shorter and covers both cases. Also, I relied on manual indexing with range and for i in range(len(words)) while the solution uses for word in words, which is easier to read and safer. In my intersect function, I didn’t check if the lists were empty, only if they were None. The solution’s extra check for length makes the function more reliable. This showed me the importance of handling edge cases properly. Another thing I missed was writing docstrings. The solution explains each function’s purpose, inputs, and outputs clearly. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain. Comparing my version to the solution helped me see that my logic is strong but my style needs polish. I’ll focus on using more standard Python, adding docstrings, and writing safer checks. I feel confident that I am able to do better next time.
